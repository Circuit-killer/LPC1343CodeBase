This simple code can be used to test the startup delay, or more precisely
the delay between the moment that reset is deasserted and code execution
begins in main().

GPIO pin 2.1 is set to output and high as soon as main is entered, so you
simply need to monitor the reset line and GPIO 2.1 on a two-channel
oscilliloscope, and measure the delay between the two rising edges.
